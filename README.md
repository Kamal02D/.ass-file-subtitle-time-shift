# .ass-file-subtitle-time-shift
# idea :
if you watch films or movies or animes in other langauges you probably need some time to add a subtitle files to videos , but the problem there is that some time the subtitles are not compatible with the video so either they start befor or after the video , our solution takes in an .ass file and a shift duration for example if your subtitle are late by 10 seconds the shift time duration will be +10 and  if there are early then the shift duration will be negative
